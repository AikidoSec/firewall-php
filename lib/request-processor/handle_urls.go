	This function acts as a last resort to protect against SSRF.
	If we didn't have enough info to stop the SSRF attack before the request was made,
	we attempt to block it after the request was made.
	If we detect SSRF here we throw an exception to the PHP layer and the response content
	of the request does NOT reach the PHP code, thus stopping the SSRF attack.
	If it's a PUT/POST request, it will actually go through, but an exception will be thrown to
	the PHP layer, thus downgrading it to blind SSRF.
	Defends agains:

- re-direct SSRF attacks (redirects lead to a hostname that resolves to a local IP address)
- re-direct IMDS SSRF attacks (redirects lead to a hostname that resolves to an IMDS IP address)

All these checks first verify if the hostname was provided via user input.
